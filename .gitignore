# --- Security (CRITICAL) ---
.env
# Never upload .env to GitHub. It contains your Mongo URI and Twilio keys.

# --- Compiled Python Files (Junk) ---
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# --- Tools & Executables ---
ngrok.exe
# No need to upload the ngrok tool, it's just for local testing.

# --- Virtual Environment (If you have one) ---
venv/
env/
.venv/

# --- IDE Settings (Optional but good practice) ---
.vscode/
.idea/
